#Minesweeper


##Introduction:
Minesweeper has been a popular puzzle game played for years. This array-generated board game represents a minefield, which consists of mines that need to be uncovered by clicking hidden tiles.  

###How to play Minesweeper:

    - This game is controlled solely by the mouse, reacting to both left and right clicks on the mouse. 

    - Some cells are covered with flags, causing the player to assume they are replaced with mines. 

    - These flags prevent a cell from being selected accidentally. 

    - A timer is displayed in the left hand corner showing the player how long it took them to finish the puzzle game.

Minesweeper consists of a level of difficulty. 

    - The more advanced a level becomes, the more the board size increases in size and in the amount of bombs!
