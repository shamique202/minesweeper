## Pseudocode:
Minesweeper has been a popular puzzle game played for years. This array-generated board game represents a minefield, which consists of mines that need to be uncovered by clicking hidden tiles.  

### How to play Minesweeper:

- This game is controlled solely by the mouse, reacting to both left and right clicks on the mouse. 

-   Some cells are covered with flags, causing the player to assume they are replaced with mines. 

-   These flags prevent a cell from being selected accidentally. 

-  A timer is displayed in the left hand corner showing the player how long it took them to finish the puzzle game. 

### More rules: 
Minesweeper consists of a level of difficulty. 

-  The more advanced a level becomes, the more the board size increases in size and in the amount of bombs!
