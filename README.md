## Pseudocode:
Minesweeper has been a popular puzzle game played for years. This array-generated board game represents a minefield, which consists of mines that need to be uncovered by clicking hidden tiles.  

### How to play Minesweeper:

- This game is controlled solely by the mouse, reacting to both left and right clicks on the mouse. 

-   Some cells are covered with flags, causing the player to assume they are replaced with mines. 

-   These flags prevent a cell from being selected accidentally. 

-  A timer is displayed in the left hand corner showing the player how long it took them to finish the puzzle game. 

### More rules: 
Minesweeper consists of a level of difficulty. 

-  The more advanced a level becomes, the more the board size increases in size and in the amount of bombs! 

## Technologies:
- HTML 

- CSS 

- JavaScript

- Command Line

- Github 

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP):
-   As a user, I should be able to click any cell to reveal it
-  As a user, I should be able to see the number of flags remaining
-  As a user, I should see a message if I win or lose the game 
-  As a user, I should be able to restart the game at any time 

## Next Steps: 
-  Allow user input for board size
-  Allow user input for the number of bombs
